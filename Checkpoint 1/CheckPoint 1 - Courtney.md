### **Business Issue**

My friends and I are creating a new Dungeons and Dragons campaign (DnD) and I am running the game as Game Master (GM).  It is my first time for a group larger than 1.  There are so many items, monsters, and attributes to keep track of, I am wondering if I can find a way to organize it all, so that the game is fun, engaging and not overpowered.
